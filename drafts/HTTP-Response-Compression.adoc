You can now configure Open Liberty (20.0.0.4+) so that HTTP responses are considered for compression. Compressing the sizes of HTTP responses, reduces bandwidth which, in turn, decreases the time taken for HTTP clients to get responses from other web services running on Open Liberty. Open Liberty first determines whether the response should be compressed. If the response should be compressed, Open Liberty then checks whether there is an encoding algorithm to perform the compression that is supported by (can be decoded by) the HTTP client that will receive the compressed response.

== Determining whether a response should be compressed

When Open Liberty is configured to compress HTTP responses, it determines whether it _should_ compress a response by checking the headers in the response:

`Content-Encoding` header:: If the response is not already encoded, it will be considered for compression. If the response is already encoded, no further attempts are made to encode the body.

`Content-Length` header:: If the body of the response is `2048` bytes or larger, it can be compressed. If it is smaller than `2048` bytes, it is too small to benefit from compression.

`Content-Type` header:: If the type of content in the response body is in the list of types configured in the Open Liberty server as being valid candidates for compression, it can be compressed.

If Open Liberty determines that the response should be compressed, it then verifies whether the response _can_ be compressed.

== Verifying whether a response can be compressed

The Open Liberty server can use the `gzip`, `x-gzip`, `deflate`, `zlib`, or `identity` encoding algorithms to compress the responses before returning them to the HTTP client that made the request. However, an HTTP client does not necessarily support all these encoding algorithms, so the client can indicate which algorithms it supports, and even which it prefers to be used.

Open Liberty chooses which algorithm to use according to the following criteria, which it evaluates in order until an encoding algorithm is identified that is supported by _both_ the HTTP client and the Open Liberty server:

. Using the `$WSZIP` private header
+
Historically, Open Liberty only considered compression when this private header was used. The value for this header indicates the desired encoding algorithm.

. Using the server's preferred algorithm
+
A preferred algorithm can be configured in the Open Liberty server using the link:https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/compression.html[`serverPreferredAlgorithm` attribute]. The value indicated by this attribute is used as long as the `Accept-Encoding` header in the HTTP request contains this name, implicitly or explicitly, with a quality value larger than `0.000`. This value is used regardless of whether there are other higher ranked quality values in the `Accept-Encoding` header.
+
For instance, consider the following header: `Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0`. Without defining a server-preferred encoding, the server would pick `gzip`, as it is the highest ranked quality value in the list. However, if `deflate` were set as the server-preferred encoding algorithm, the same `Accept-Encoding` header would result in `deflate` being chosen.

. Using the HTTP client's preferred algorithm
+
The HTTP client can indicate which algorithms are supported and its preferred algorithms in the `Accept-Encoding` header of the HTTP request. These are sorted in descending order by the server and each value is evaluated until a valid encoding is found. The highest ranked valid algorithm is chosen. If the `gzip` algorithm is tied among the highest ranked, it is chosen as the algorithm to use. If there are no explicitly named encoding algorithms, and an asterisk (`{star}`) is used, `gzip` is used if possible. If `gzip` cannot be used, `deflate` is used. If both are declared as unsupported by means of a quality value of `0.000`, no content encoding algorithm is chosen.
+
For example, assuming the `$WSZIP` header and the server's preferred algorithm are not specified:

     - The HTTP client can specify the preferred encoding algorithm as `gzip` by giving it the highest quality value:

    Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0

      - The HTTP client can specify multiple encoding algorithms with the highest quality value. In such cases, the server picks the `gzip` algorithm if possible:

      Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=1.0, gzip;q=1.0

      - The HTTP client may also indicate all encodings are supported. As the `gzip` algorithm is supported, the server chooses it:

      Accept-Encoding: *

      - The HTTP client can specify the `gzip` algorithm is *not* supported. In this case, the `deflate` algorithm is used instead.

      Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0, *

      - The HTTP client can specify it does *not* support either the `gzip` or `deflate` algorithms. In this case, no compression algorithm will be chosen.

      Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0, deflate;q=0, *


If an appropriate encoding algorithm is not found, or if the encoding algorithm is `identity`, no compression is attempted.

Additionally, as the `Accept-Encoding` header influences the Open Liberty's process for selecting and representing the response, a `Vary` header with the value of `Accept-Encoding` is also added to the response. This header informs cache intermediaries that this responseâ€™s content may change in a subsequent request if the `Accept-Encoding` header changes. The header is added regardless of whether the response is ultimately compressed or not, as long as compression is configured in the `server.xml`.

== The Accept-Encoding header in HTTP requests

The `Accept-Encoding` header in HTTP requests specifies which algorithms the HTTP client supports or does not support. The values provided by this header can optionally be accompanied by a quality value, ranging from `0.000-1.000`, which indicates a preference for the encoding. When the quality value is omitted for an encoding algorithm, the Open Liberty server interprets it as having a value of `1.000`. On the other hand, a value of `0.000` indicates that the HTTP client does not support the algorithm. The use of the asterisk (`*`) symbol is supported to indicate all encoding algorithms that are not explicitly mentioned by the header.

For example, an HTTP client can specify that it supports the `gzip` and `deflate` algorithms by setting the `Accept-Encoding` header to `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`, it could specify that *any* encoding is supported with `Accept-Encoding: *`. The client can also indicate a preference for `gzip` over `deflate` (though both are supported) with `Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0`, or that no other algorithm should be used with `Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0, *;q=0`

== Try it out

To use HTTP response compression, you need *Open Liberty 20.0.0.4*. Configure the `server.xml` with a new element called `<compression>`. You can configure compression for all HTTP endpoints or separately for each HTTP endpoint. See link:https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/#compression.html[Compression Options (compression)] for more details of the options.

=== Configuring compression for all HTTP endpoints

[source, xml]
----
    <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
                        httpPort="9080"
                        httpsPort="9443"
                        compressionRef="myCompressionID">
    </httpEndpoint>

    <httpEndpoint id="otherHttpEndpoint"
                        httpPort="9081"
                        httpsPort="9444"
                        compressionRef="myCompressionID">
    </httpEndpoint>

    <compression id="myCompressionID" serverPreferredAlgorithm="deflate|gzip|x-gzip|zlib|identity|none>" types="list_of_types"/>
----

=== Configuring compression separately for each HTTP endpoint

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
                        httpPort="9080"
                        httpsPort="9443">
    <compression serverPreferredAlgorithm="deflate|gzip|x-gzip|zlib|identity|none>" types="list_of_types"/>
</httpEndpoint>
----

===  Configuration pitfalls

If the HTTP transport encounters a configuration that is considered invalid, a warning message with an appropriate message is logged. If this happens, the link:https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/#compression.html[default value for the attribute] that was misconfigured is used.

The following message keys are associated to misconfigurations of the `<compression>` element's attributes: `CWWKT0029W`, `CWWKT0030W`, `CWWKT0031W`, `CWWKT0032W`, and `CWWKT0033W`.
