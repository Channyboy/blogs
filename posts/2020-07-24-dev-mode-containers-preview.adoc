= Fast iterative development with Open Liberty dev mode and containers
Eric Lau <https://github.com/ericglau>

When developing an application that will eventually be brought to production, potential issues can be avoided by ensuring that your development and production environments are as similar as possible.  This aligns with link:/blog/2019/09/05/12-factor-microprofile-kubernetes[Twelve Factor App] methodology, particularly factor 10 which calls for dev/prod parity.  Part of this is addressed by using containers, where your environment can be codified to give consistency in development and production.

In this post, we introduce a technology preview for container support in Open Liberty dev mode.  This lets you develop applications on your local environment while your Open Liberty server runs in a container.  The development image is kept as similar as possible to the production image while allowing for iterative development, so that your code changes are automatically hot deployed to the container and picked up by the running server.  Additionally, dev mode lets you run tests either automatically or on demand, and you can attach a debugger at any time to debug your application.

Note that since container support is in technology preview, its features and parameters are subject to change in future milestones or releases of the Liberty Maven Plugin.

== Defining an application image

When defining the image that includes your runtime environment and application, the recommended approach is to write a Dockerfile that specifies the environment and adds the application and corresponding configuration.  For example, see the pattern for link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#building-an-application-image[Building an Application Image].  This works well when you have finished a certain amount of development, and want to test out your changes in a container.

Without using dev mode, you could compile and package your application, then run the `docker build` command to rebuild your image which includes any changes that you have made to your application or its configuration.  However, this restarts the server each time and is not ideal for iterative development.  For iterative development, Open Liberty dev mode can be used to help improve this experience and allow for fast turnaround times.

== Iterative development

With container support for Open Liberty dev mode, you can use the same Dockerfile for both development and production.  This means you use the same base image and customizations, and specify the exact configuration files that you need for your application in your Dockerfile so that you don't get any surprises when you proceed to deploy your application into production.  Dev mode makes some changes in the way that the image is built and run in order to enable iterative development, so the images are identical except for how the application and configuration files are mounted into the container.  With dev mode, simply save a source file in any text editor or IDE, and it will be recompiled and picked up without needing to rebuild the image or restart the server.

== Starting dev mode with container support

For Maven projects, specify the Liberty Maven Plugin with version `3.3-M2` in your projectâ€™s `pom.xml` file.
[source,xml]
----
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.3-M2</version>
    </plugin>
----

Create a Dockerfile in your project root directory as shown in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#building-an-application-image[Building an Application Image], including COPY commands for your application and configuration files.

Start dev mode with container support by running the following command in your project: `mvn liberty:devc`. This compiles your application, builds the development image, and runs the server in the container.

You can continue to make changes to your source code or configuration files while dev mode is running.  Quit dev mode at any time by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal, or type `q` and press Enter.
