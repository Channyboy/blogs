= Jakarta EE beta on Open Liberty
Alasdair Nottingham <https://github.com/nottycode>

Our first Open Liberty beta (released today) makes available the first three Jakarta EE 9 features that we've implemented. We'll be releasing betas every four weeks and adding more Jakarta EE 9 features as we go.

== Open Liberty betas

When we first released the Open Liberty open source project, we focused mainly on adding production-quality capabilities to Liberty and releasing completed features. While we have often talked about our in-development work so that you know what's coming, the only way to get hold of this unfinished code to it try out was to take a look at our nightly builds. This is never ideal because nightly builds can be somewhat unstable, so we wanted to release a regular Open Liberty beta.Â 

Open Liberty betas will contain everything in the most recent Open Liberty release plus features that are not yet finished. While these features are not yet suitable for use in production, we want to get feedback from our user community and them available to developers to use ahead of a production release. Of course, something appearing in a beta isn't a guarantee that it'll end up released: the feedback might be that it is a horrible, terrible, no good, very bad idea, and should be constrained to the dumpster of git history. At the very least, it might change a bit.

== Betas and releases every four weeks

We intend to release a new beta every four weeks at the same time as our normal four-weekly Open Liberty release. Usually, the beta will be available on the same day as the normal Open Liberty release, so the second beta, 20.0.0.8-beta, will be released on the same day as the 20.0.0.8 Open Liberty release. Today's beta (our first), however, is versioned as 20.0.0.7-beta but we've released it two weeks earlier than the Open Liberty 20.0.0.7 release. 

This first beta is out of cycle because we wanted our first beta to align with the Jakarta EE 9 Milestone 1 to showcase our Jakarta EE 9 work. So far, Open Liberty has implementations of the `servlet-5.0`, `jsp-3.0`, and `el-4.0` features. We will be adding to this list in future betas as we work towards complying with Jakarta EE 9 specification. We are running the TCKs as we go (LINK?).

In line with Liberty's zero migration policy, as we did with Jakarta EE 8, we will be releasing new versions of all the relevant features so that your existing applications will continue to work unchanged with the feature versions they are currently using. If you want to run with the Jakarta EE 9 features, you can either recode to make use of the Jakarta EE 9 APIs, or you can use the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.transformer[Eclipse Transformer] to bytecode-rewrite references to Jakarta EE 8 code to Jakarta EE 9. We have been using this tool on Liberty to provide the new Jakarta EE 9 features and it has so far been very successful.

If you want to get started with the beta just update your pom.xml to pull the Liberty beta instead of the release using these coordinates. It works with Java SE 11 or Java SE 8.
