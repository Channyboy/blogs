Open Liberty 20.0.0.12-beta comes complete with a range of previews for MicroProfile updates, including support for MicroProfile 4.0 and accompanying updates to MicroProfile Config (2.0) and JWT (1.2). Also available for preview are a multitude of Jakarta EE 9 features amongst which are changes to the Jakarta RESTful Web Services specification and the addition of message-driven bean support.

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.
[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features:

* <<mp4, Support for MicroProfile 4.0>>
* <<conf, Support for MicroProfile Config 2.0>>
* <<jwt, Support for MicroProfile JWT 1.2>>
* <<lra, Support for MicroProfile LRA>>

[#mp4]
=== Support for MicroProfile 4.0

The Open Liberty 20.0.0.12-beta provides most feature updates for MicroProfile 4.0-M1, this includes updates to MicroProfile Config, Fault Tolerance, Metrics, Health, Open Tracing, Open API and JWT, detailed below. While MicroProfile Rest Client is part of the MicroProfile 4.0-M1 specification, this feature narrowly missed the beta train and is scheduled for delivery in milestone 2.

MicroProfile 4.0 brings the following feature updates to Open Liberty:

* Config 2.0
* Fault Tolerance 3.0
* Metrics 3.0
* Health 3.0
* Open API 2.0
* JWT 1.2
* Open Tracing 2.0

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `pom.xml`:

[#conf]
=== Support for MicroProfile Config 2.0

link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile] Config is a specification which OpenLiberty implements to allow application configuration from different locations (ConfigSources). In the previous versions, OpenLiberty has implemented the specification in its own codebase. However, for MicroProfile Config 2.0 it consumes link:https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye's implementation] of the specification.

MicroProfile Config 2.0 is a major version release (from 1.4) which introduces API/SPI changes and functional changes.

==== Functional Changes

* Provide a way to retrieve a number of related configuration properties with a specified prefix into a CDI bean, using the @link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/inject/ConfigProperties.java[ConfigProperties] annotation.

[source, java]
----
@ConfigProperties(prefix="customer")
@Dependent
public static class BeanOne {
   private String name;
   int age;
}
----

retrieves the following defined properties for the `name` and `age` fields:

[source, java]
----
customer.name=Bob
customer.age=24
----

* Allows end users to easily determine which was the "winning" `ConfigSource` (the `ConfigSource` with the highest ordinal) for a specified property via link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/ConfigValue.java[ConfigValue]. A `ConfigValue` object holds information about the configuration property name, configuration value, the ConfigSource name from where the configuration property was loaded and the ordinal of the `ConfigSource`. Users can access these values with the following method:

[source, java]
----
ConfigValue cv = Config.getConfigValue(String propertyName);
cv.getSourceName() // the config source that supplies the configure value for the above property
----

* Enables an application to include configuration for different environments and development stages while only one of them is active (e.g. dev, test, prod) via Configuration Profiles. The Config profile can be specified via the `mp.config.profile` property, which can be set in any of the configuration sources. Once it is set, the corresponding properties associated with the active profile are used. The value can also be set at application start-up, for example:

[source, xml]
----
java -jar myapp.jar -Dmp.config.profile=testing
----

The `mp.config.profile` property can works on property level and config file level.

** On Property level
The property can be utilised by setting Config property values specific to the selected profile. For example, the `vehicle.name` property in the following example would be set to `bike` from the previous Config start up command:

[source, java]
----
%dev.vehicle.name=car
%testing.vehicle.name=bike
vehicle.name=lorry
----

If `mp.config.profile` was not set, `vehicle.name` would be set to `lorry`.

* On microprofile-config.property level

The property `mp.config.profile` also activates the corresponding `microprofile-config-<mp.config.profile>.properties` while `microprofile-config.properties` as the fallback.

* Support link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-2.0-RC1/microprofile-config-spec.html#property-expressions[Property Expressions], which provides a way to set and expand variables in property values. For example, in the following configuration properties, the property `server.url` will be resolved to `http://example.org/endpoint`:

[source, java]
----
server.url=http://${server.host}/endpoint
server.host=example.org
----

*Note*: Previous working configuration may behave differently (if the used configuration contains values with Property Expressions syntax).

* Two new methods have been introduced to link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/Config.java[Config.java]:
** `Config.getValues(String propertyName, Class<T> propertyType)`
** `Config.getOptionalValues(String propertyName, Class<T> propertyType)`

The methods have been added to allow users to retrieve multi-valued properties as lists instead of arrays. The methods return the resolved property values with the specified `propertyType` for the specified `propertyName`.

* `OptinalInt`, `OptionalLong` and `OptionalDouble` are now provided as built-in link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-2.0-RC1/microprofile-config-spec.html#converter[Converters]. The new Converters can be used like any of the other built-in Converters, converting injected Config property values to a defined Type:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "my.optional.int.property")
  private OptionalInt optionalIntProperty;
----

=== Incompatible changes

If you move up from MicroProfile Config 1.x, 2.x, please take care of the following incompatible changes.

* `ConfigSource.getPropertyNames` is no longer a default method. The implementation of a `ConfigSource` must implement this method.
* Previous versions of the specification would not evaluate Property Expressions. As such, previous working configuration may behave differently (if the used configuration contains values with Property Expressions syntax). Set the property `mp.config.property.expressions.enabled` with the value of `false`.
* Empty values or other special characters are no longer valid Config property values. This means that `Config.getValue(String propertyName, Class<T> propertyType)` will never return `null`; a `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown if either a Config property value is not defined, is defined as an empty string, or its converter returns `null`. In the previous release, the empty value was returned as an empty value. For more information, please refer to this link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-2.0-RC1/microprofile-config-spec.html#_config_value_conversion_rules[section[].

[#jwt]
=== Support for MicroProfile JWT 1.2

The MicroProfile JSON Web Token 1.2 specification allows using a JWT token for authenticating and authorizing requests to a service. The specification simplifies the configuration for managing the validation of the JWT by introducing new MicroProfile Config properties. Enhanced signature algorithm support is added in this Open Liberty beta.

Version 1.2 of the MicroProfile JSON Web Token specification adds the following MicroProfile Config properties to control different aspects of the JWT validation.

==== mp.jwt.token.header

The `mp.jwt.token.header` property allows you to control the HTTP request header which is expected to contain a JWT token. You can specify either Authorization (default) or Cookie values.

==== mp.jwt.token.cookie

The `mp.jwt.token.cookie` property allows you to specify the name of the cookie which is expected to contain a JWT token. The default value is `Bearer` if not specified.

==== mp.jwt.verify.audiences

The `mp.jwt.verify.audiences` property allows you to create list of allowable "aud" values. At least one of these must be found in the claim. Previously, this had to be configured in the server.xml file. Now, you can configure the audiences in the MicroProfile config property as follows:

[source, java]
----
mp.jwt.verify.audiences=conferenceService
----

==== mp.jwt.verify.publickey.algorithm

The `mp.jwt.verify.publickey.algorithm` property allows you to control the Public Key Signature Algorithm that is supported by the MP JWT endpoint. The default value is RSA256 if not specified. Previously, this had to be configured in the server.xml file. Now, you can configure the public key algorithm used for verification of the JWT in the MicroProfile config property as follows:

[source, java]
----
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.algorithm=ES256
----

The specification also adds support for the ES256 signature algorithm, while this Open Liberty beta supports using the RS384, RS512, HS384, HS512, ES256, ES384, and the ES512 signature algorithms.


To enable the the MicroProfile JWT 1.2 feature in your app, add the following to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
   <featureManager>
       <feature>mpJwt-1.2</feature>
   </featureManager>
----

link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-jwt-auth-spec.asciidoc[MicroProfile JWT 1.2 Specification]

[#lra]
=== Support for MicroProfile LRA

Long Running Actions (LRA) provides a cloud native transaction model based on a compensating Saga model which allows loosely coupled services to coordinate long running activities, guaranteeing eventual data consistency without the need to take locks on data.

The features provide a Coordinator, to which LRAs along with any corresponding compensating method are registered, and the participant which allows microservice methods to be annotated to create a new or join an existing LRA.

To start or join a LRA use the `@LRA` annotation. Depending on the type provided it may always create a new LRA, join the existing LRA or create a new one, join the existing LRA or continue outside one if none is provided, etc. A full list of options can be found in the Microprofile Long Running Actions link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-lra-spec.adoc[specifications].
An example of always creating a new LRA when called would be:

[source, java]
----
    @LRA(LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW)
    @Path(“/start”)
    @PUT
    public void startAction(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId)
    {
        /*
         * Business logic that may call upon other services to participate in this Long Running Action
         */
         return Response.ok().build();
    } 
----

Once the LRA had been successfully finished all participating service will have their `@Complete` annotated methods called to perform the necessary cleanup

[source, java]
----
    @Complete
    @Path("/complete")
    @PUT
    public Response completeAction(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId)
    {
        /*
         * Business logic to cleanup resources once the LRA has closed successfully
         */
         return Response.ok().build();
    }  
----

Should a service in an LRA be canceled or timeout the `@Compensate` methods for each participating service in the LRA will be called

[source, java]
----
    @Compensate
    @Path("/compensate")
    @PUT
    public Response compensateAction(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId)
    {
        /*
         * As the LRA has been canceled business logic to compensate any changes is necessary
         */
         return Response.ok().build();
    } 
----

To enable the LRA Coordinator feature in your app, add the following to your `server.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>cdi-2.0</feature>
    <feature>jaxrs-2.1</feature>
    <feature>mpLRACoordinator-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

To enable the LRA Participants feature in your app, add the following to your `server.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>cdi-2.0</feature>
    <feature>jaxrs-2.1</feature>
    <feature>mpLRA-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----
