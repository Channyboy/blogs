You can now configure Open Liberty (20.0.0.4+) to compress HTTP responses. Compressing the sizes of HTTP responses reduces bandwidth which, in turn, decreases the time taken for HTTP clients to get responses. Open Liberty first determines whether the response should be compressed then, if so, checks whether there is an encoding algorithm to perform the compression that is supported by the HTTP client.

== Determining whether a response should be compressed

When Open Liberty is configured to compress HTTP responses, it first determines whether it _should_ compress a response by checking the headers in the response:

`Content-Encoding` header:: If the response is not already encoded, it will be considered for compression. If the response is already encoded, no further attempts are made to encode the body.

`Content-Length` header:: If the body of the response is `2048` bytes or larger, it can be compressed. If it is smaller than `2048` bytes, it is too small to benefit from compression and no attempt will be made to compress it.

`Content-Type` header:: If the type of content in the response body is in the list of types configured in the Open Liberty server as being valid candidates for compression, it can be compressed. Otherwise, no attempt will be made to compress it.

If Open Liberty determines that the response should be compressed, it then verifies whether there is an acceptable algorithm available to compress it.

== Verifying whether a response can be compressed

The Open Liberty server can use the `gzip`, `x-gzip`, `deflate`, `zlib`, or `identity` encoding algorithms to compress responses before returning them to the HTTP client that made the request. However, an HTTP client does not necessarily support all these encoding algorithms, so the client can indicate which algorithms it supports and even which algorithm it prefers to be used.

Open Liberty chooses which algorithm to use according to the following criteria, which it evaluates in order until an encoding algorithm is identified that is supported by _both_ the HTTP client and the Open Liberty server:

. The value of the `$WSZIP` private header
+
The value for this header in the response indicates the desired encoding algorithm.

. The server's preferred algorithm
+
A preferred algorithm can be configured in the Open Liberty server using the link:https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/compression.html[`serverPreferredAlgorithm` attribute]. The value indicated by this attribute is used as long as the `Accept-Encoding` header in the HTTP request contains this name, implicitly or explicitly, with a quality value larger than `0.000`. This value is used regardless of whether there are other higher ranked quality values in the `Accept-Encoding` header.
+
For instance, consider the following header: `Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0`. Without defining a server-preferred encoding, the server would pick `gzip`, as it is the highest ranked quality value in the list. However, if `deflate` were set as the server-preferred encoding algorithm, the same `Accept-Encoding` header would result in `deflate` being chosen.

. The HTTP client's preferred algorithm
+
The HTTP client can indicate which algorithms are supported and its preferred algorithms in the `Accept-Encoding` header of the HTTP request. These are sorted in descending order by the server and each value is evaluated until a valid encoding is found. The highest ranked valid algorithm is chosen. If the `gzip` algorithm is tied among the highest ranked, it is chosen as the algorithm to use. If there are no explicitly named encoding algorithms, and an asterisk (`{star}`) is used, `gzip` is used if possible. If `gzip` cannot be used, `deflate` is used. If both are declared as unsupported by means of a quality value of `0.000`, no content encoding algorithm is chosen.
+
For example, assuming the `$WSZIP` header and the server's preferred algorithm are not specified:

     - The HTTP client can specify the preferred encoding algorithm as `gzip` by giving it the highest quality value:

    Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0

      - The HTTP client can specify multiple encoding algorithms with the highest quality value. In such cases, the server picks the `gzip` algorithm if possible:

      Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=1.0, gzip;q=1.0

      - The HTTP client may also indicate all encodings are supported. As the `gzip` algorithm is supported, the server chooses it:

      Accept-Encoding: *

      - The HTTP client can specify the `gzip` algorithm is *not* supported. In this case, the `deflate` algorithm is used instead.

      Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0, *

      - The HTTP client can specify it does *not* support either the `gzip` or `deflate` algorithms. In this case, no compression algorithm will be chosen.

      Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0, deflate;q=0, *


If an appropriate encoding algorithm is not found, or if the encoding algorithm is `identity`, no compression is attempted.

Additionally, as the `Accept-Encoding` header influences the Open Liberty's process for selecting and representing the response, a `Vary` header with the value of `Accept-Encoding` is also added to the response. This header informs cache intermediaries that this responseâ€™s content may change in a subsequent request if the `Accept-Encoding` header changes. The header is added regardless of whether the response is ultimately compressed or not, as long as compression is configured in the `server.xml`.

== The Accept-Encoding header in HTTP requests

The `Accept-Encoding` header in HTTP requests specifies which algorithms the HTTP client supports or does not support. The values provided by this header can optionally be accompanied by a quality value, ranging from `0.000-1.000`, which indicates a preference for the encoding. When the quality value is omitted for an encoding algorithm, the Open Liberty server interprets it as having a value of `1.000`. On the other hand, a value of `0.000` indicates that the HTTP client does not support the algorithm. The use of the asterisk (`*`) symbol is supported to indicate all encoding algorithms that are not explicitly mentioned by the header.

For example, an HTTP client can specify that it supports the `gzip` and `deflate` algorithms by setting the `Accept-Encoding` header to `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`, it could specify that _any_ encoding is supported with `Accept-Encoding: *`. The client can also indicate a preference for `gzip` over `deflate` (while supporting both) with `Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0`, or that no other algorithm should be used with `Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0, *;q=0`.

== Try it out

To use HTTP response compression, configure the `server.xml` with a new element called `<compression>`. You can configure compression for individual HTTP endpoints or for all endpoints at once. See link:https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/#compression.html[Compression Options (compression)] for more details of the attributes.

Configuring compression for individual HTTP endpoints:

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
                        httpPort="9080"
                        httpsPort="9443">
    <compression serverPreferredAlgorithm="deflate|gzip|x-gzip|zlib|identity|none>" types="+application/*, -text/plain"/>
</httpEndpoint>
----

Configuring compression for all HTTP endpoints:

[source, xml]
----
    <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
                        httpPort="9080"
                        httpsPort="9443"
                        compressionRef="myCompressionID">
    </httpEndpoint>

    <httpEndpoint id="otherHttpEndpoint"
                        httpPort="9081"
                        httpsPort="9444"
                        compressionRef="myCompressionID">
    </httpEndpoint>

    <compression id="myCompressionID" serverPreferredAlgorithm="deflate|gzip|x-gzip|zlib|identity|none>" types="+application/*, -text/plain"/>
----
The `types` attribute in the examples adds all application content types except for `text/plain`.

With this new `<compression>` configuration option, you can configure Open Liberty to compress HTTP responses before returning them to clients. This reduces bandwidth and the time taken for HTTP clients to get responses.
